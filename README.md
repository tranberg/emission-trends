Danish GHG Emissions
====================

An overview of GHG emissions from Denmark presented with a Sankey diagram. Inspired by [A Flowchart of New Zealand's Greenhouse Gas Emissions](https://www.mfe.govt.nz/publications/climate-change/flowchart-new-zealands-greenhouse-gas-emissions).

Example output: [Interactive figure](https://emissions.tberg.dk/).

Currently only emissions from 2018 are shown. There is data going back to 1990, so one could visualize the development over time as well.

Made with Python (Jupyter Notebook) + Plotly.

There are two notebooks: one including fugitive emissions and one without.

The version included here differs slightly: Spelling of row names have been changed in a few places to be consistent across sheets.
